An Offering of Peace
-------------------------------------------

*in narrator voice*

The sun was nearing the horizon line - the sky burned red with a fiery spirit. The rice goddess was upon them. Jake and Lulu (I just named them, ok), having appeased the giant panda, thought that they were safe. But It was too soon to rest.

As dawn broke, The Rice Goddess (not the holy one, the normal rice goddess) brought an army of owos, prepared to burn down the uwustorage without hesitation. The giant panda nibbled on the single grain of rice as the owos surrounded our two young'uns. Lulu got up to help defend the uwustorage, but Jake up his hand up to stop her. "You're too sick to fight this one". He stepped outside the uwustorage. Jake's cat meowed. Jake himself snorted. (don't ask why).

The rice goddess demanded that a sorrel - one that she is very sure is a sorrel - to be made as a sacrifice. She handed them a special uwu to aid them. "This shall be the only uwu thy may use", she declared. The goddess reclined into a golden throne just outside the storage. Jake and Lulu were not prepared for this. They couldn't leave the uwustorage, after all. Lulu wondered... how exactly she got herself into this situation - or if she would even make it out alive. A trickle of blue light escaped from her hand, which she quickly covered, without Jake's notice. He couldn't know that her sickness was getting worse.

*what will happen to Jake and Lulu? It's up to you to decide*

DM the Rice Goddess on discord with your sacrifice.

Hints
-------------------------------------------
- The goddess is kinda blind...

- This challenge may take a while... (even if you know what you're doing) (like from 10 minutes to 3 hours depending on your system)

- *final hint is unlockable on the rtcp website*
