Tea Clicker
-------------------------------------------

It's not too far back in my memory when cookie clickers were all the rage. But this new one with tea and cats has such great art and themes, I'm hooked! Unfortunately, the only reward is so many clicks away, and even if I spend double the time, I still can't get it!
