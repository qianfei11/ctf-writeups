I think my `ls` is being haunted... the colors are all weird!!! What's that? It's highlighting things?! Where!!?

Hints
-------------------------------------------
- Flag is `100` characters long.

- It starts with `rtcp{` and ends with `}`
  
- The first character is `w`
  
- The flag is written in standard leet, the only exceptions are the flag wrapping (`rtcp{}`) and underscores (`_`)
